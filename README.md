# Add-On Translation

Welcome to the **Add-On Translation Repository**!  
This repository is dedicated to enabling the community to contribute to translating various Tomhmagic Creations Add-Ons. By working together, we can make these Add-Ons accessible to a wider audience around the world.

---

## Add-Ons

The repository is organized into subfolders, each representing a specific Add-On:

- **Realight Reimagined**
- **Economy+**
- **Emojis**

Within each subfolder, you'll find an existing language file `en_US.lang`, which serve as the base translations.

---

## How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome in the form of improvements to existing files. 

- You may **edit current translation strings** to improve accuracy or clarity.  
- You may **add new translation strings** for keys that are missing in a language file.  

However, edits to the `en_US.lang` and `en_GB.lang` files are not allowed, as these serve as the base reference files and are locked to maintain consistency.
`en_GB.lang` files are only used if providing English spelling tranlsations such as color => colour


### Steps to Contribute:

1. **Fork the Repository**:  
   Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Edit Existing Translation Files**:
   - Open the corresponding `.lang` file for the language you wish to update.
   - You may edit current translation strings to improve accuracy or clarity.
   - You may add new translation strings for keys that are already present in the `en_US.lang` file but are missing in the target language file.

3. **Follow the Formatting Rules**:
   - Each line should follow the format: `key=value`.
   - Do not alter keys (`key`) as they are used in the code.
   - Ensure all values (`value`) are accurately translated and localized.
   - Do not add new keys to any `.lang` file.

**Note**: `en_US.lang` is the base language files, so for a new language to be complete, all keys from `en_US.lang` must be translated.

4. **Submit a Pull Request**:
   - Commit your changes and submit a pull request to this repository.
   - Provide a clear description of your changes, including the language and region code.

**Note**: Adding new `.lang` files or modifying `en_US.lang` and `en_GB.lang` is not permitted.

### Example

If you want to add a German translation for **Realight Reimagined**:

2. Open the file named `de_DE.lang`.
3. Add/Edit translations following the format.

### Rules

- **Do Not Edit Base Files**:  
  The `en_US.lang` and `en_GB.lang` files are read-only and should not be modified.

- **Respect the Format**:  
  Maintain the file structure and formatting for consistency.

- **Be Respectful**:  
  Ensure translations are accurate and culturally appropriate.
